## Bio

Hi! I am Tural Sadigov, a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at [Hamilton College.](https://www.hamilton.edu/) I am an applied mathematician by training. Since 2015, I have become fascinated by the power of data, and the areas of machine learning and statistics. I now teach data science and statistics courses, research in the intersection of applied mathematics and deep learning, and keep up with new innovations in the data science world.

I implement active learning strategies in my classes with various mini and not-so-mini projects. I believe in learning via teaching and engagement.

In my free time, I play with my son, and watch and play soccer.
