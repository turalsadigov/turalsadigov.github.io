## Bio

Hi! I am Tural Sadigov, a staff data scientist at [Sepion Technologies](https://sepiontechnologies.com/) in the San Francisco Bay area. I am an applied mathematician by training. Since 2015, I have become fascinated by the power of data, and the areas of machine learning and statistics. 

I now use data to improve the range of EV batteries at the same time keeping their cost down and making them safer. In my free time, I play with my son, and watch and play soccer.
